# LOGME

## A Logging Class

Logs are saved to a file by session/user (On-Device Logging), then these files are pushed to a Firebase Storage (Remote Logging)

This framework logs by: 	
- Level of Severity
- Session / User-based
- With Tags
- Environment (debugging, staging, production)

## Configuration 

The System can be setup by configuration (based on Environment)


## Tests 

Unit tests are included for the framework.


## Driver Sample:

Driver is a dummy project that uses the logger to create a few logs.
